Welcome to Shihan (David) Ma's datahouse!

This is the top-level repository for supplementary data, tables and illustrations associated with my published papers. I reckon the provided materials would be of extra help and reference value to readers and am happy to provide more detail on request. Each session here corresponds to an individual paper and each may contain its own readme describing the contents as well as any updated information or caveats.
